CPU Scheduler
    The CPU Scheduler allocates the process which need to be executed after the process ends.
Dispatcher
    The module that gives control to CPU or allocates that is selected for execution
Dispatch latency
    The time taken to stop one process and start other process is called dispatch latency.

Preemptive and No Preemption

The circumstances where the CPU Schedules are,

1.When Process in Running State to Ready State.(Interrupt)
2.When Process Waiting State to Ready State.(I/O Operations)
3.When Process Running State to Waiting State.
4.When The Process is terminated.

In 1 and 2 The Process which is in ready state can be interrupted or can be in waiting state so it can be preempted so it is called Premption.
In 3 and 4 The Process Starts without any interruption so it can be of Non Preemption Scheduler.

To allocate the Process the CPU maintains a Certain Algorithms
  First In First Out-It allots the process which came First.
  Shortest Job First-It allocates the process which has the shortest burst time.
  Shortest Job remaining Time-Allocates the process which has the less completion time.
  Priority Scaheduling-Allocates the process which has the highest priority.
  Round Robin
