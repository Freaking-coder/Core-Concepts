Starvation
    Starvation is the factor that occurs mostly in Priority scheduling.
    In Priority Scheduling the highest Priority process executes first while the process with less priority waits for the long time to execute.
    This waiting of the process is called as starvation.

Aging
    Aging is the technique to avoid starvation in the priortity scheduling.

Starvation may lead low system performnace due to long wait of the process.
