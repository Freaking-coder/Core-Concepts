The Producer-Consumer Problem is The problem which deals with process synchronization.
Producer is the one which always produces while Consumer is the One which consumes what the producer produces.

Here the problem for the producer consumer problem 
-->The Producer can't produce and insert anything into the buffer while it is full.
-->The consumer can't consume anything if the buffer is empty.
-->The producer and the consumer both can't produce and consume from the buffer simultaneously.

To avoid thisProblem we have a Semaphore we deal with that.
The three semaphore will be helpful in solving this problem is
mutex()-->Acquire and release the lock.
empty()-->Initial value is number of slots.
full()-->Initial value is 0.
