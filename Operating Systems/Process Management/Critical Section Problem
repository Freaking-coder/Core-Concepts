The critical Section is the section where a certain process will be performing operations like updating variables or values and changing datatype.
These kind of process is called as a critical section.

Problem of critical Section are:
--->When a Process is executing in a critical section ,the other process can't execute in its critical section.

The sections of a process in the critical section are
    If the process request to execute in its critical section then it is called as request mode.
    The process in the entry of the critical section is entry section.
    The section is then followed by exit section.
    Then the Remainder section.

The critical section should satisfy the following requirements:
Mutual Exclusion:
      When a Process is in the critical section then the other process can't execute in their critical section.
Progress:
      If no process is executing in the critical state then the other process can request when it is not in remainder mode.
Bounded Waiting:
      The critical section of a process is executing,The other process is requesting to execute in critical section.But the request that is making can also have some limits and bounds.
