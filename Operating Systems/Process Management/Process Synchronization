Consider,
    The producer and consumer problem where both can't do their actions concurrently,we would face the data manipulation. 
    To avoid this condition we need process synchronization.

Race Condition:
    The Producer and consumer Problem Produces a wrong result while it was working concurrently.This condition is called race Condition.

The Operating System has Buffer (temporary storage location to access the data faster)
The buffer can be of two types
Bounded Buffer-  The Bounded buffer has a fixed size.
Unbounded Buffer-  The Unbounded buffer has a unfixed size.
