An Operating System (OS) is the fundamental software that manages hardware and software resources
on a computer. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, ensuring that all
applications run smoothly and that resources like CPU, memory, and storage are allocated efficiently.

It provides an environment where applications can run and users can interact with the computer.

Example of OS : Windows, Android and iOS, Linux, macOS

System software : It help to manage and operate the computer hardware so that other software can
function.
Ex : Compiler (Convert high-level code to machine language), Operating Systems (OS) , Utility
Software(Antivirus software which perform specific tasks related to system maintenance and optimization)

Application software : It is designed to perform specific tasks for users. It runs on top of the system software
and interacts with it to carry out its functions.
Ex : Word Processor(Used for writing and editing documents.)

-> System software is essential for the computer to function, while application software provides tools for
specific tasks.

-> System software typically comes pre-installed with the computer, while application software is usually
installed separately.
User Interaction: The user interacts with the application (Text editor) and
requests to save the document.

Application-OS Interaction: The application sends a system call to the
operating system to request writing the document to the storage device

OS-Hardware Interaction: The OS communicates with the hardware
through the file system and storage device drivers to physically write the
data to the storage medium.

Hardware: The hardware performs the actual writing of data to the disk.

Components of Operating system

The operating system is a complex software made up of various components that work together to
manage system resources, ensure security, and provide an interface for users and applications. Each
component has a specialized role, but all are critical for the overall functioning of the OS and the stability of
the system.

Kernel – The core of the OS that manages system resources.
Process Management Module – Handles process creation, scheduling, and execution.
Memory Management Module – Manages RAM allocation and virtual memory.
File System – Organizes and manages data storage.
Device Drivers – Allows communication between the OS and hardware.
User Interface (CLI/GUI) – Enables user interaction with the system.

Goals of Operating system

These define the purpose of the OS

Efficiency – Ensure optimal use of system resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.).
User Convenience – Provide a user-friendly interface (CLI/GUI) for interaction.
Security & Protection – Safeguard system data and processes from unauthorized access.
Multitasking & Parallel Processing – Support multiple processes and users efficiently.
Reliability & Fault Tolerance – Ensure system stability, error handling, and recovery.

Primary functions of an OS

Process Management -> Operating system manages the creation,
scheduling, and termination of processes on the computer. It allocates
CPU memory to different processes to run simultaneously, allocating CPU
time among them.

Memory Management -> Operating system allocates memory to
processes when needed and frees it when no longer required. It
implements virtual memory, allowing the use of secondary storage as an
extension of RAM for larger applications.

File System Management-> Operating system manages files on disk,
organizing them into folders and directories for easy access and storage. It
handles file creation, deletion, and modification. It also helps in managing
file access permissions and security.

Primary functions of an OS

Device Management-> Operating system manages input/output devices
(printers, keyboards, disks, etc.) and provides a layer of abstraction, allowing
applications to interact with hardware through drivers.

Security and Access Control-> Operating system enforces user authentication,
permissions, and protects against unauthorized access. It provides security
features like firewalls and antivirus software.

Networking-> Operating system manages network connections and data sharing.
It facilitates network communications, allowing devices to connect, share data, and
access resources over local or remote networks.

User Interface-> Operating sytem provides an interface for users to interact with
the system, typically through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user
interface (GUI). It also allows users to execute commands, manage files, and
interact with applications in a user-friendly way.
