Normalization
    Normalizatiion is the process to reduce the redundancy in the table.
    It does not guarantee to remove the redundancy and it will reflect it reducing the Redundancy.
Normalization Types
    First Normal Form
    Second Normal Form
    Third Normal Form
    Boyce Cott Normal For(3.5)
First Normal Form
    To follow the 1 NF the values should be atomic.As it should have any multivalued attribute.
    Example:In the order column can be Food and drinks and it need to be splitted to be in first normal form(Multivalued-->SingleValued)
Second Normal Form
    It should be in 1NF.
    NO Partial Dependency.
Third Normal Form
    It should be in 2NF
    It should contain any transitive dependency(A->B,B->C,A->C)
Boyce Cott Normal Form
    Refinement of 3rd Normal form so it should be in 3NF.

Denormalization
    It is the vice versa of Normalization
    It deals with increasing or introducing redundancy to solve more complex queries.
Advantages
    Faster Queries
Disadvantages
    Data Inconsistency and Data Redundancy
