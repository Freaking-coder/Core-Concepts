ER Model
  Entity Relationship model describes the relation between the entities in the visual form.
Entity-Is a Physical form or a object like for Example:Book,Employee
Entity an be divided into 
    Strong Entity-Can exist independently without the other entity
    Weak Entity-Cannot Exist independently (denoted by double rectange)
Attribute-Characteristics of an entity Example:For a Entity Employee there can be a attribute of Empid,Empname

Types of Attribute
Simple Attribute
  -Simple Attribute is an atomic attribute which cannot be divided further.(Denoted by Oval)
  -For Example,Consider a Example Name can be divided into First and Last name which can't be divided further.
Composite Attribute
  -Composite Attribute is a attribute that can be divided further
  -Consider Address attribute which can be divided into city and State.

  -An Attribute That consist only of single value like Phone number or email id.
MultiValued Attribute
  -An attribute that has a multiple value like Name can be of Multiple value.(Denoted by double oval)
Derived Attribute
  -An attribute that is derived from the other attribute within the database.(Denoted by Doted Oval)

Can be of Strong and weak Relationship
Strong Relationship- Relation between the entitites is like it can exist without each other.
Weak relationship- Relation between the entitites is like it cannot exist without each other.

Based on the cardinality/degree(Attributes)
One to One relationship
One to many relationship
Many to one relationship
Many to Many relationship
